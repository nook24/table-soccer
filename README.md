## JavaScript based table soccer trainer
a friend of mine found an Android App, that is made for table soccer players to train their reaction speed.
The problem was he didn't own an android device. So he asked me if it's possible to create something similar as a web app.

At the moment the page is made for iPhone 5s. I don't know how it behaves on other devices...

## How it works
First of all you need to setup how you want to train.

In the next step, flip your device and start start training. Shoot at the goal, if you hear the beep sound.

## Requirements
A web server - that's all.

No PHP or database required!

## How to install
You just need a webspace where you can place the content of this repository.

If you have shell access you can simply clone this repository
````
git clone https://github.com/nook24/table-soccer.git
````

If you just have some FTP credentials for your webspace [download the zip version](https://github.com/nook24/table-soccer/archive/master.zip) and copy it to your webspace.

If your done browse to the folder where you placed the files.

## Demo
If you don't like to install your own web server for this or just want to see how it works, [here is a demo for you](https://nook24.eu/kicker/).
